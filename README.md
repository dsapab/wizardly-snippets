# Wizardly Snippets

This is a personal collection code snippets, commands and small samples that I crafted (or copied üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è) and saved me in one of those [(not-so) read-only fridays](https://isitreadonlyfriday.com). Rather than having them abandoned in a shady forgotten folder, I am sharing them so they can hopefully be useful for you as well.
