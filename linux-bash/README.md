## Get the last field with awk
```
TASK_ID=$(echo $TASK_DETAILS | jq -r '.TaskARN' | awk -F '/' '{print $NF}')
```

## [grep](https://linux.die.net/man/1/grep) simple text matching

The ```grep``` command is a very powerful tool that can help us to find matching patterns, keywords or even phrases across a large number of files. While using the flags ```-r``` for recursion and ```-n``` for printing line numbers, we can easily find occurrences of a given string across an entire directory. Much more complex searches can be done with regular expressions.
```
grep -nR "keyword" ./*
```

## Load settings from a file with awk

The following sample uses `sed` and `awk` commands for reading a configuration file, parsing the content and loading configurations. In this particular sample the file has some defined properties and may look like:
```
scripts_dir = '/some/path'
zip_name    = 'important-file.zip'
zip_dest    = '/some/other/path'
```
The following script can then be used for picking up the contents:
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Config
cfg_file=/path/to/your/file
tmp_cfg='settings.tmp'

# Read file
sed 's/ //g' $cfg_file | sed 's/\t//g' > $tmp_cfg

# Pick of values
scripts_dir=$(awk -F "=" '/scripts_dir/ {print $2}' $tmp_cfg)
zip_name=$(awk -F "=" '/zip_name/ {print $2}' $tmp_cfg)
zip_dest=$(awk -F "=" '/zip_dest/ {print $2}' $tmp_cfg)

# Do stuff...
...
```

## Sanity checks on script

Sample script that performs sanity checks and verifies if given commands exist before proceeding. It also creates an alias for OS inter-compatibility (MacOS/Linux).

```
#!/bin/bash

# 1. Sanity checks

if ! command -v aws &> /dev/null
then
    echo "'aws' may not be installed, please double check it."

elif ! command -v sha256sum &> /dev/null
then
    echo "Looking for alternative 'shasum' commands..."

    if ! command -v shasum &> /dev/null
    then
        echo "'shasum' could not be found in any variant, please install it."
        exit 1

    else
        alias sha256sum='shasum -a 256'
    fi

elif ! command -v zip &> /dev/null
then
    echo "'zip' could not be found, please install it."
    exit 1

fi

##Â Do stuff...
```


## System resources stress
Stress the system memory, filling up-to 90% of the RAM. The ```0.9``` value can be tweaked to fill diferente percentajes of the RAM memory.
```
stress-ng --vm-bytes $(awk '/MemAvailable/{printf "%d\n", $2 * 0.9;}' < /proc/meminfo)k --vm-keep -m 1
```
Stress the disks:
```
stress-ng --hdd 4 --timeout 60m /efs/
```
